# DataMiningCourse
A collection of projects, assignments, and implementations from my data mining course.
Disclaimer: For the analysis of insights derived from IMDb and TMDb data, the datasets used for clustering were reduced to 200,000â€“250,000 records (from the original 430,000) due to computational limitations and to prevent kernel crashes caused by memory constraints. Additionally, the datasets cannot be uploaded to this repository.
